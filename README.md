# Ebike
This project is a parts list with pricing and links to build a nice, fast, classic looking bike with an electric motor.

I did an ebike build from scratch then realized the parts list of other DIY ebike builds would have been a helpful place to start. 

This version rides like a Cadillaic, but I'm sure this setup could be modified to do whatever you need.
