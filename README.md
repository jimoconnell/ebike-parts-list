# DIY Ebike Parts List
I wanted an ebike that looked like a normal bike, would get me to work and back without breaking a sweat, and was light enough to carry up the stairs to my apartment.

After doing this build from scratch, I realized a full parts list of other DIY ebike builds would have been a helpful place to start. 

Modify this parts list to make a bike that fits your needs.
